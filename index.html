                Oh, junk food. It's often hard to resist and once you start munching away at some, it's even harder to stop. 
                While indulging occasionally isn't going to harm you, if you happen to find yourself eating quite 
                a bit of junk food every day, you're going to want to put down that bag of potato chips. See, while junk food may be tasty, 
                there are plenty of downsides if you're eating it every day. <br>
                So to help you avoid falling into this dangerous pattern, 
                we're uncovering some of the scariest side effects that can arise if you happen to eat junk food daily. 
                (Instead, focus on 21 Best Healthy Cooking Hacks of All Time!)

            <h3> 1. You'll gain weight.</h3>
                
            This one should come as a no-brainer. If you happen to eat ultra-processed food every day, 
            you're going to pack on the pounds. One study compared body weight changes and calorie consumption 
            for 10 men and 10 women who ate either an ultra-processed or a minimally processed diet for two weeks. 
            Those who were on the ultra-processed diet ate about 500 calories more per day, ate faster, and gained 2 
            pounds on average. Big yikes. That's why you'll want to avoid eating the unhealthiest snacks on the planet every chance you get!
           
            <h3>2. Your mood changes.</h3>

            It's true—what you're putting into your body every day does impact your mood. In fact, 
            90% of serotonin receptors are located in the gut, so you obviously want to make sure you're 
            feeding your gut properly. A diet that is filled with highly processed food and chemical additives 
            isn't going to help you maintain a healthy gut, though. Plus, there are studies that link eating a healthy, 
            balanced diet such as the Mediterranean Diet, and avoiding inflammation-producing foods (like junk food) may help when it comes to fighting depression.
